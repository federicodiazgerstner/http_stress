# http_stress

For a university project, we created a simple HTTP Server Stresser in Python. It consist of a simple Flask server and two .py scripts: one for multithreading and
another for multiprocessing.

Within each script, you have to complete to which URL you'll be sending GET Requests, as well as the number of request and de number of threads/processes you would
like to use.
